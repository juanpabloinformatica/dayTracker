- Expectations

  - This will take a long period of time.
  - I would like to have the possibility to speak in any single layer of computer science with a good understanding
  - Master my profession

- Ideas
  - Considering learning about low level programming
  - Read and do all the exercices of the book -> c the hard way
  - Today I was thinking in pulishing my git skills, so maybe is good
    to spend some time doing this katas.
