- ### Roadmap components

  - Basics
    - DataStructure: Implement the basic data structures:  
      - dynamicArray
      - Stack
      - Queue
      - LinkedList
      - Hashmap
      - Binary search tree
      - Graphs

     by only using recursion, so it means no loop in the whole project, just for the testing suite,  using generics in C by the (void*) functionalities and trying to make it a little bit OOP.

    - ComputerFoundations: Following the autoguided course nand2tetris both first and second part, this teach from the logic gates until a functional computer.

    - EnsimagProjects: I wil try the most interesting projects give by my old school, One of the best in the world for sure. SEPC projects, Compiler and OS advanced are going to be my focus.

  - Functional programming: I will follow the autoguided course OCaml Programming: Correct + Efficient + Beautiful, This will teach a better way to write code but at the same time a different way to solve problems, that will help me at the moment of understanding different recursive algorithms.
  - DiscreteMaths: I will follow an MIT open course autoguided as well, this will help me with proof theory and other stuff needed to understand algorithms.

  - Algorithms: After following all the previous courses, I think I will be in the capacity to read, and implement all what is explained in the book even the more complex algorithms.

## Areas of study

- Computer foundations
- Data structure and algorithms
- Discrete maths

## Daily work schedule

### Basics

- Was decided to organize my study schedule

  - Retake nand2tetris, It has been more than a month that I haven't seen it
  - Everything we start we finish it
  - So schedule will be the following:

    - Mondays ->  nand2tetris[2]
    - Tuesdays ->  dsa[1]
    - Wednesdays ->  nand2tetris[2]
    - Thursdays ->  dsa[1]
    - Fridays ->  nand2tetris[2]
    - Samedi ->  dsa[1]
    - Dimanche -> Ensimag projects[0]

### FunctionalProgramming

 This need to be after finishing **Basics** for that
 reason is not defined yet.

### DiscreteMaths

 This need to be after finishing **FunctionalProgramming** for that
 reason is not defined yet.

### Algorithms

 This need to be after finishing **DiscreteMaths** for that
 reason is not defined yet.

## Expectations

- This will take a long period of time.
- I would like to have the possibility to speak in any single layer of computer science with a good understanding
- Master my profession

## Ideas

- Considering learning about low level programming

- Read and do all the exercices of the book -> c the hard way --> **I need to work more on this**
- Today I was thinking in pulishing my git skills, so maybe is good
    to spend some time doing this katas.
    link: <https://github.com/eficode-academy/git-katas>

- I was thinking in taking notes of everything and maybe put it in
    a book like the ocaml one. If I do follow this.
    link: <https://myst-parser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>

- I need to start doing a brief summary of each chapter that I have done
  in nand2tetris, I have taken a lot of different approaches I am conscious that
  are not the more efficient but in this moment I am looking for developping thinking 
  reasoning and have things done by my owns means.

- I was thinking in using USACO roadmap for preparing myself for competitive programming
  Advantages: roadmap already defined: --> 
  This will take time but is matter of patience

- Improve c++ knowledge
- I will writte the os with c++
- C++ [4]
- Operating systems [5]
- Improve tools such as nvim, tmux, keytyping and keep checking for learning
- Ocaml comes after i think is not that necessary right now

# Description
- Today. I will try to explain what are the planning now, I don't think give this up.
- And explain what has happened the last days.
