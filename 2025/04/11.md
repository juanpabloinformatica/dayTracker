# Description

- Today I was working in linux cli's

  Things learned:

  - lsof for checking opened files
  - dig for checking information about dns and and getting from ip address the server
    `dig -x <ip_address>`
  - command xargs with -I flag let us put the input in the middle of a command
    is a way to simulate `find -exec <command>{} `
  - sudo -u <user> let execute a command as the <user>
  - sudo -i <user> to log as that <user>
  - For switching the shell -> su username | if another user looging in su - username
  - pstree - p --> really helpful for show the process_tree

    ```bash
    systemd(1)-+-bluetoothd(8330)
               |-crond(644)
                          |-dbus-broker-lau(513)---dbus-broker(517)
                                     |-incrond(532)
                                                |-iwd(519)
                                                           |-lightdm(649)-+-Xorg(657)-+-{Xorg}(666)
                                                                      |              |           |-{Xorg}(667)
                                                                                 |              |           |-{Xorg}(668)
                                                                                            |              |           |-{Xorg}(669)
                                                                                                       |              |           `-{Xorg}()`
    ```
    - uptime gives the information how long the machine has been running
    - pgrep -> get process id with grep -> this is not that crucial I think | another way ps aux | grep ....
    - pkill -> kill process passing using grep for getting process id
    - diff | can be done as sdiff and also diffstat piped diff diference give a summary


  - init_http server with python lib http/server.py

  still things to be done

  - Everything related to bash script
    - subshells (written in parenthesis)
    - set -x .....
    - set -x .....
    - kinds of variable expansions
  - redirection of multiple lines of input
  - httpie | curl
  - rsync
  - pandoc
  - nohup & disown
  - for monitoring progress part pv,pycp,pmonitor,progress 
  - All system debugging part
  - one-liners
  
- Now I will focus on reading the c_book
