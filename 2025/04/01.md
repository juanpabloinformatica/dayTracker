# Description

- So I finish the first part of nand2tetris yesterday.
  Today, I will be working in the second part of that course
  but I was thinking the following, I was thinking it could be better
  if I do it in C languague instead of c++, even if c++ provides more
  functionalities, I think is better to follow the process I was following before.

- So the idea is the following now I will invest 1:30 of nand2tetris
  then I will try to invest time in what could be better in the dsa and algorithms 
  approach. Maybe following a course or maybe reading c the hard way that has all
  the different things I think i should need. I will investigate about that later.

  - So now I am thinking what should be the next steps. I need to improve
    in dsa and algorithms that's a fact. Eventually I will need to have a good
    foundations in C for the rest of projects I am whilling to do but I also need 
    C++ for the jobs I will be looking for.
