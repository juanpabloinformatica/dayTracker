# Description

- Finishing the video of C++ from
  C, either way still things to check

  in C, but after that recover nand2tetris
  the vm and also start the course of algorithms

  I saw until minute, 1:44:13
    - Need to practice Optional, Variants, Expected
    - Iterators

- Now I will keep going with nand2tetris but what I will do
  is trying to do the vm but first designing everything that I should 
  do in order to get there.
