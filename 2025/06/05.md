# Description

- Today I will be working on nand2tetris, I checked both the videos
  and read a little bit now I will follow the following process

  ```mermaid

    flowchart LR
    subgraph CreateWorkflow
        direction TB
        general[General steps] --> specific[Specific steps]
    end
    subgraph Information
        direction TB
        videos[video source] --> reading[reading source]
    end
    Information --> CreateWorkflow
    CreateWorkflow -- "if x step is ready" --> A[Implement step]
    A -- "if implementation fails and no idea" --> Information
    A -- "if x step is done and can be tested" --> B[test step]
    B -- "if x step test succeed" --> CreateWorkflow
    B -- "if x step NOT test succeed" --> A
    CreateWorkflow -- "Doubts" --> Information

  ```
