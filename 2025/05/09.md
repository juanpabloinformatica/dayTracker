# Description

- Today, I want to keep going with nand2tetris
- In tomorrow's section I need to spend time trying 
  to look for a mechanism that puts more pressure on me
  for accomplish things faster, but keeping the mentality
  of everything takes time.

- I am thinking in putting the different projects in diff github
  repositories, and then try to use submodules instead, I think could be
  more organize doing like so.
