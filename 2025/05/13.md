# Description

- Today I am thinking of doing 3 things
- recheck makefiles, advances tricks --> currently working on it
  and recursive makefiles.
- check about makefiles and see if how can I apply it
- check and continue with cli coreutils + bash
- Later probably at night keep going with nand2tetris.
- Need to update github profile --> something for minimal
- Need to update linkedin
