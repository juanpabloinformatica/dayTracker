# Description

Today I will be working on:
  - Nand2tetris (It should be diff but I am too behind)

    - Add unit test
    - Make chapter 7 work

    - Refactor 
      - src/CodeWritter.cpp
      - src/Control.cpp

      - Before was working but because I was realizing the operations
        in the ram memory portion belonging to the vm-process (c++ code),
        so the problem was that when I face the next character as I harcoded
        the values of the arithmetic operations when the loop logic was 
        implemented, it was not dynamically getting the values in the actual 
        position

      - Now I changed the logic to make the hardware do that, by doing transl
      ations, so now the ram of the running process is not doing arithmetic
      calculations, is only saving values.

      - The problem I am facing is that I need to reorganize the code
        each function of the codewritter I am planning to make unit testing
        with ctest google test framework

      - For the refactoring that will be after.


        
        
        
## Steps
   - What do I need for the gtest to work: 

      - I need the files [X]
      - I need to compile the files []

        - This is what I will do
          I will compile appart gtest
          create an ar or .so and link it to my tests

          - So as I need a main, I will need to have
            gtest_main.so (Depends on libgtest.so)

            - check how libgtest.so is generated

        



      - I need to link those files to my testfiles []
      - I need to use the main provided by gtest []
