# Description

- I forgot to do it at the beginning of the day
  but basically I studied
  - c/c++ compilation process
  - c/c++ libraries --> (I should made one)
  - Makefiles: check this -> still things to be studied (link: https://makefiletutorial.com/)
    from variables pt2 --> forward
  - Now I will try to do the implementation of the makefile by myself of nand2tetris and advance
    with the next modules
