# Description
- This day i formally failed, I didn't study as always, nevertheless it was my second day of official work.

- But even working I am planning to keep studying aside as I have been doing, that's the reason is considered failure.

- I continue looking how wsl could work on windows. but at the end of the day I really don't want to continue with window. So I was thinking to see possibilities to make ti work with linux.

- Did some initial configurations but nothing really done yet.
