  - Thursdays ->  dsa[1] | nand2tetris[2]

  - Today I will focus in advancing dsa.
    A lot of things needs to be done.
    Fix some issues, check free handling and finish
    with graph basic functions.
    
  - If time, I will try to finish the CPU, that I have taken 
    a lot of time to finish.
