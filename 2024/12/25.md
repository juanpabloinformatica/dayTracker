# Description

- Wednesdays ->  nand2tetris[2] | dsa[1]
- Advance nand2tetris project 5
    
- I advanced the cpu chip, but still missing last
  control bit, It has to consider the zg, and ng
  of the alu + the C instruction.

- If time, I will try to advance dsa
  Maybe refactoring, maybe starting free 
  management or going to graph.
  I will try to refactor a little bit
  then free for everything.
