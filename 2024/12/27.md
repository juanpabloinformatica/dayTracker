# Description

- Today I will try to catch up with
  nand2tetris, I want just to review
  everything for been more update of 
  everything I have learnt, and then
  focus 100% in the project 5.

- So now I will focus on reading every
  chapter until 5.
- Fridays:  nand2tetris[2]

- Still need to figure out zr and ng 
  control bits emmitted by the ALU, but 
  is a progress, I know in which direction
  to see. Register d also I should add the 
  instruction checker just in case.

- Now I will try to start looking how the graph
  can be implemented.
