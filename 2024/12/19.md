# Description

- Today, I will continue making the setup of the computer,
  nevertheless, I will try to check why I was having issues,
  with archlinux installation, besides if everything work
  with the archinstall, I will do it by myself, also the 
  script should install all the packages manual, inorder
  to make it more linux general and not attach only to 
  archlinux.

- In this moment I will check if the archinstall works as I 
  would like, then I would like to do the installation with 
  an script that will be able to be fetched from github.
