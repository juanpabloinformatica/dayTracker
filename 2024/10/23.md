What is supossed to be done today

## Itineray

- I will do a little change just this following weeks, because I think
it will be quicker if I improve my dsa, recursion and algorithmic problem solving.
I think the coding skills are enough by now.
- I will start with dsa, where i leave it and then check how the book implemented it.
